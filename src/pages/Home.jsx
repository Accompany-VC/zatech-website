The group is intended to be high signal, low noise. Think of it as an overlapping series of professional groups rather than IRC in the 90s.

Be kind. Don’t be snarky. Have curious conversations — don’t cross-examine. Comments should become more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic becomes more divisive.`}

To request an invite, send an email to invite@zatech.co.za from an address you intend to use long term (not your work email — you’ll be in this community for a long time). Include your name, occupation, a brief explanation of why you want to join, and how you heard about us.

Finally, please include a link to your LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, or another site that shows you’re a real person.
